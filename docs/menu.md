## Introduction

This is a simple document explaining our thought process during the creation of the menu, and how it is structured.

A schema is in progress to better explain how the menu works.

## The needs

It's important to us that the client has a good interaction with the software, and that it is as easy to interact with as possible.
Therefore, we've designed the menu with the most important options showing right away, just to then explore them a little more.
